We don't collect or store your data, period.

We don't even know how to do that. And that will never be our thing because we value your time and attention. We  will never clutter your inbox, mess up your social media timelines or ask you if you want to announce to all your friends, relatives and co-workers that you got the highest score ever.

We hope you enjoy our games.
